Create a CSS-only image gallery

- choose a theme for your gallery and title it appropriately (the weirder the better)

- minimum of 6 images, all of the same dimensions

- keep images external

- each image must have a caption

- must use at least two 3D transforms

- must transition at least 3 properties (including both 3D transforms) when hovering over an image/image container

- layout should be responsive - images should float next to each other and wrap to the next line when the screen shrinks

- must render/function correctly in WebKit (Chrome/Safari) only

- progressively enhance the gallery - make all images & captions visible to browsers that don't support 3D transforms

- go crazy - we're not worried about subtlety on this one
